Base project for Algorand on AWS lambda

**Algorand** is a **blockchain cryptocurrency protocol** created by Silvio Micali (professor at MIT and winner of the Touring award in 2012), and based on the pure proof of stake consensus mechanism.
It ensures full participation, protection, and speed within a truly decentralized network. 
It focuses on:
- Interoperability
- Private and Public Models
- Performance and Scale
- Layer-2 Smart Contracts

A **serverless** application is a compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You need zero administration so you can focus on the software instead of infrastructure management and let AWS maintain and scale the server for you.

This application shows how to develgitop a simple serverless Java software and deploy and test it on AWS Lambda. 
It executes two straightforward tasks on the Algorand Blockchain:

- Retrieve the total amount of Algos of an Account 
- Send Algos between accounts

Nevertheless, it can be used as a template to develop more complex solutions.
